## Hello there 👋

I'm Manuel, a System Engineering student based in Argentina.

My main tech stack is C# (.NET Framework / .NET), SQL Server, Microsoft Azure & Windows.

I have also worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js & Sequelize, but just the basics.

📚 Recommended Readings
I'm a bit of a bookworm, so here are some books that have shaped my thinking:

Software Engineering & Architecture
The Pragmatic Programmer - Like a wise uncle giving you life advice, but for coding. The 20th anniversary edition is a must-read IMO.
Fundamentals of Software Architecture - Architecture explanations without the ivory tower attitude. Practical and down-to-earth.
The Mythical Man Month - Written in 1975, still painfully relevant.
Design Patterns - The famous "Gang of Four" book. Like learning chess openings, but for code. Sometimes overkill, often enlightening.
Dive Into Design Patterns - A modern, practical take on patterns; got it from the mythical refactoring.guru and can't recommend it enough. It also has a solid intro to OOP.
Building Microservices - Helped me understand when to split services (and when not to). Also a good intro to architecture, containers and so.
Computer Science & Mathematics
Algorithms Illuminated - Makes algorithm analysis feel less like rocket science and more like solving puzzles. I'm not a math guy, but this book made me feel like I could actually understand it.
Concrete Mathematics - A rollercoaster of "I get it!" followed by "Wait, what?" moments. Challenging but rewarding; it's Knuth's book after all.
Book of Proof - Made mathematical proofs click for me. I forgot most of it already, but it's a good book to have on your shelf.
Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces - "Easy" might be stretching it, but it makes OS concepts digestible. Great virtualization explanations.
A Mathematical Theory of Communication - Shannon's 1948 paper that started it all. Dense but foundational.
The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood - Gleick's masterpiece. Explores information from ancient drums to the digital age. Mind-expanding.
Tools & Infrastructure
Network Warrior - Friendly, down-to-earth networking book.
Git Internals - Understanding Git's belly made me stop treating it like a "save game" button. This is one of the books I also recommend in my Git In C# project.
The Blockchain Developer - Demystifies blockchain beyond the hype. The cryptography chapters alone are worth it.
Industry Insights & Others
Joel on Software - Blog-turned-book that aged like fine wine. The tech changed, but the wisdom remains. Plus, Joel's funny AF.
Soft Skills - I absolutely love this book, it has a ton of useful tips for developers and non-devs alike.
The Lean Startup - A must-read for anyone who wants to build a startup. It's a bit outdated, but the principles are still valid.
How to F*ck Up a Startup - Very funny and insightful startups for those who learn from mistakes (i.e., everyone).
Papers & Articles
Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures - Fielding's dissertation on REST. Also a solid intro to software architecture.
On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models - An interesting paper on AI safety.
Concrete Problems in AI Safety - Another hard recommend on AI safety. Robert Miles has a series of videos about this paper that's also worth a watch.
